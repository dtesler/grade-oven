<h2>About Grade Oven</h2>
<p>Grade Oven, written by <abbr title="Mikel Dmitri Mcdaniel">Mikel Mcdaniel</abbr>, is a minimalist web server where instructors can make assignments to build/run/grade student code.  In practice, it's more flexible than that, but the main goal is allow students to submit programming assignments and get instant feedback with a focus on security (protecting the server from potentially malicious students).
